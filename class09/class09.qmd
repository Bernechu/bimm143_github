The main database for structural biology is called the PDB. Let's have a look at what it contains:

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from "Analyze" > "PDB Statistics" > "by Experimental Methods and Molecular Type".)

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
stats
```

```{r}
stats$Total
```

These are characters not numeric...

```{r}
as.numeric(sub(",", "", stats$Total))
```

```{r pdbstats, message=FALSE}
library(readr)

stats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
stats
```

```{r}
n.total <- sum(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(stats$`X-ray`)
n.em <- sum(stats$EM)

percent.xray <- (n.xray)/n.total*100
percent.xray
percent.em <- (n.em)/n.total*100
percent.em
```

There are `r round(percent.xray, 2)` percent Xray structures in the PDB and there are `r round(percent.em, 2)` percent Electron Microscopy structures in the PDB.

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(stats$Total[1]/n.total*100,2)
```

## Exploring PDB structures

Package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

Let's first use the Mol* viewer to explore the structure.

![My first view of HIV-Pr](1HSG.png)

And a view of the ligand (ball and stick) with catalytic ASP 25 amino-acids (spacefill) and the all important active site water molecule (spacefill):

## PDB object in R

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

Extract the sequence

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

```{r}
chainA_seq <- pdbseq(trim.pdb(hiv, chain="A"))
```

I can interactively view these PDB objects in R with the new **bio3dview** package. This is not yet on CRAN

To install this I can setup **pak** package and use it to install **bio3dview** from GitHub. In my console I first run

install.package("pak")

```{r}
library(bio3dview)

view.pdb(hiv)
```

Change some settings

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(hiv,resno=25)

view.pdb(hiv, highlight = sel,
         highlight.style = "spacefill",
         colorScheme="chain", 
         col=c("blue","orange"),
         backgroundColor = "pink")
```

## Predict protein flexibility

We can run a bioinformatics calculation to predict protein dynamics - i.e. functional motions.

We will use the `nma()` function:

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Generate a "trajectory" of predicted motion

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="ADK_nma.pdb")
```

```{r}
view.nma(m)
```
